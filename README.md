## Rough Project Descriptions
### 1. Counterfeit/Bootleg/Appropriation
This project will run for the next several weeks (8/26–9/30), it has several parts. Each part is its own “sub project” — meaning a thread need not continue from stage to stage.

```
- Multi week project (4? 5?) -- start with one thing, and make a counterfeit; then make a bootleg; then make an appropriation... What kinds of reflection do we ask them to do at the end? what is the "learning" from this? 
- workshops/lectures/readings: what is homage? what is appropriation? what is a bootleg? what is a counterfeit? seems like the curation stuff -- at least objects -- would fit in here potentially well; the translation of regularly encountered stuff into pattern library? - Something about collaboration or exchange, unexpected results? definitely automation/algorithms as they are so good at "copying" and looking for patterns/themes. Orson welles' F for Fake. Brazilian Cultural Cannibalism. 
```

#### Counterfeit:
Definitions / To make an imitation or copy of (something), usually with the intent to defraud.; To carry on a deception; dissemble. made in imitation so as to be passed off fraudulently or deceptively as genuine; not genuine; forged. pretended; unreal. an imitation intended to be passed off fraudulently or deceptively as genuine; forgery. to make a counterfeit of; imitate fraudulently; forge. A ripoff of a legitimate thing that should exist/does exist…

Pick a designed something from out in the world. Make a counterfeit of it…

This thing you pick should be something that you think very highly of. How is it the best example of whatever design it is? what can you learn from replicating it?

#### Bootleg:
Definitions / To make, sell, or transport (alcoholic liquor) for sale illegally. To produce, distribute, or sell without permission or illegally. To engage in the bootlegging of alcoholic liquor or another product.  an unauthorized audio or video recording. An unofficial remix. To attach a transmitter to a dish antenna, creating an uplink via which a signal is sent to a satellite without the knowledge of the satellite's owner. A product, especially alcoholic liquor, that is illicitly produced, distributed, or sold.  Produced, sold, or transported illegally: bootleg gin; bootleg tapes. something that is made secretly and sold illegally. illegally made, copied, or sold. Something that shouldn’t exist. It is illegal not because it is fake or an illegitimate copy; but because it is  meant to be controlled or desired to be kept out of the public (music bootleg tapes; bootleg alcohol made illegitimately to avoid prohibition or alcohol taxes)

#### Appropriation:
to take without permission or consent; seize; expropriate: He appropriated the trust funds for himself. to steal, especially to commit petty theft. the act of setting apart or taking for one's own use. the act of taking something such as an idea, custom, or style from a group or culture that you are not a member of and using it yourself. The act of taking or using things from a culture that is not your own, especially without showing that you understand or respect this culture. Appropriation in art is the use of pre-existing objects or images with little or no transformation applied to them. The taking over, into a work of art, of a real object or even an existing work of art.

### 2. Remix.
This Project will run from 10/07–10/28 (the four weeks of October)

> Special note for Fall break: All sections will be granted the week off, not just M/Tu; But I&K will be available for individual meetings the W/Th/F.

- Watch: Everything is a remix
- Watch: Ways of Seeing
- Read: Ways of Seeing? Barthes? Foucault? 
- Listen: New Ways of Seeing (BBC Radio)

```
- (4 wks?) So we take a project of someone elses -- from the counterfeit et al project? -- and do a new "remix"
- This seems like a good companion to the communicating a design princple w/ limited means; the experience for someone who wasn't there through a new medium (again, sort of a remix)...
- Good opporunity to think about meaning making; how to use new metaphors or different forms/knowledge domains to convey the same ideas; or the same initial metaphors but with new meanings...
- Everything is a remix -- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nJPERZDfyWc
```

### 3. Dictionary 2.0
- Audit of Influences.
- Gerhart Richter Painting / Storehouse of treasures?
- (4 wks?) What inspires you; sure graphic design things; but let's look bigger and broader than that too -- there have to be other things you care about; are interested in; how do we catalog and utilize these things in one's desinging...
- Any of the criticality things work here... 
- the everyday experience based design idea fits here well too

Create a dictionary to aid you in your potential degree project research and development. Research and define terms, ideas, and visual reference points associated with your questions and ideas. This “dictionary” is meant to help fill in conceptual gaps, refine direction, and enhance and inform so you can move forward with confidence.

Knowledge domain?

How might we questions?

### 4. Process Book.
- Final project; the last 4 weeks or so to refine it -- but should be introduced at the beginning; its the documentation for all the projects? Must contain reflection on the term as well as all the different questions, outcomes, whatever created from the projects and workshops -- try to frame a process; a practice; a praxis.

## Workshops/Charettes/In Class Prompts:
1. Intro + Design Principles Installation
2. Translation Project
3. Curation of Objects
4. Exhibition Prototyping
5. Exhibition Prototyping
6. Audit of DP Ideas. Identify a trend or convention in graphic design and create a critical response to it.
7. Design something about your everyday experience. (ritual, rules, protocols, economies)
8. Design something that communicates the notion of time in a fixed/static medium
9. Opt. Ind Meetings
10. Use material choice to communicate the same message in different ways— opposite, subversive, enhanced
11. Exhibition Prototyping
12. Translate something that you encounter regularly into a graphic language / pattern library
13. Book Prototyping
14. Opt. Ind Meetings
15. Take an ethical stance on the design industry/technology
16. What is the future of the design profession?

## Lectures?
- Free/Libre/Open Source/Public Domain?
- Basic Semiotics refresher

## Anything else??

## Other Good Questions:
- What do you think about this? what do you think you are supposed to think about this? 
- how do you feel about this, how do you think you are supposed to feel about this?
- What is the weirdest thing you would advocate for?
